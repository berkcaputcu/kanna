/**
 * Rewrite of transcripts written before tool results stopped carrying
 * `debugRaw`.
 *
 * Every Claude tool result used to store the whole raw provider message next
 * to its own `content`. For a screenshot read that is 600 KB of base64 held
 * twice, and three chats here passed 100 MB on disk. Nothing reads that copy
 * except the lift of `tool_use_result` for `ask_user_question` and
 * `exit_plan_mode`, so the rewrite keeps that one field as `structuredResult`
 * and drops the rest. `system_init` keeps its `debugRaw`: the raw JSON view
 * shows it, and it is a few KB. Every other kind loses the field. Inline images move to disk in the same pass
 * (see `transcript-media.ts`), through the `transform` hook.
 *
 * The file is streamed line by line and never held whole: the point is to
 * shrink files too large to parse comfortably, so parsing them whole first
 * would defeat it.
